// require.context is a webpack feature that allows us to get all the files in a directory
// false means don't look in subdirectories (only check this directory)

// uncommenting the 2 const and .map will allow to use a folder of images sorted by rank
// It has been updated to fetch links of the images on a separate server to load faster

//const requireContext = require.context('@/images/projects', false, /\.jpg$/);
//const images = requireContext.keys().map(requireContext);
