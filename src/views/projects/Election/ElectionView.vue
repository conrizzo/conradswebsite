      <p class="align-text-left" style="padding: 1rem; ">A small project started for convenience to have
        quick links to 2024 U.S.A election related items.
        <br><br>
        <u>Notice</u>: Polls have margins of error and any one poll (especially if it is a smaller sample size) is
        likely not a
        great indicator. When multiple independent polls using good
        practices yield similar results it is safer to make conclusions. Human decisions cannot be perfectly decided
        with polling or math,
        but as more good data is available the sentiment of who will get more votes, or the direction of the election
        becomes more clear.
      </p>
      <p class="align-text-left" style="padding: 1rem; ">Another important fact to note. Polls are conducted usually by
        interviewing people
        and this is a fixed event based on when the polls are conducted. These results can change every few days, or every week. For better or worse for one election candidate.
        Betting markets, where a users incentive is to profit off of their prediction may have a user update their bets
        multiple times a day - which means it is a more fluent real time anaylsis of what people want to put their money on since
        they stand to
        lose money if they are disengaged. The problem with these prediction markets is these don't represent regular
        voters since the vast majority of regular voters are not betting on the outcome with election prediction market websites.
       </p>
        <p class="align-text-left" style="padding: 1rem; ">
        It's also possible to gauge the state of the race by viewing user sentiment online. e.g. If more <i>real</i> people
        think Donald Trump is crazy, and people are tired
        of hearing his insults. It's more <i>likely</i> to conclude sentiment of him is bad. On the other hand if more <i>real</i> people
        think what he is saying are "good points" it bodes better for him. User sentiment is hard to track, but search engines and other social media websites
        would be able to analyze this data in a more real time sort of way.
      </p>
