# https://conradswebsite.com to see what this code does


### This iteration of the website was started from a blank slate around March of 2023.
### Mainly is a personal website project made by me, Conrad Lundberg. Largely written in Vue.js, TypeScript. Links to a few small projects in React.js/Next.js as well, as well as some other frameworks/languages. The backend at the moment uses the Flask framework and runs Python.
### The point of this website has been to have a place to do creative website projects, practice some development, and possibly build some useful web applications. Should a project idea come up I can link it in to this website somewhere.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### The main Vue.js build is deployed to a linux webserver running Nginx for the frontend.
### 

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
