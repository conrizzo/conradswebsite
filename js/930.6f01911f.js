The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.

I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ” </p></article><h1 style="color:red;" data-v-520f13b0> Learning things with grid with this code </h1>',6),d=[o];function s(e,a,t,r,o,s){return(0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("main",n,d)}var l={date(){return{birdPicture:t(9758)}}},f=t(3744);const c=(0,f.Z)(l,[["render",s],["__scopeId","data-v-520f13b0"]]);var v=c},9758:function(e,a,t){e.exports=t.p+"img/Kohlenmeise.3b49d678.jpg"}}]);
