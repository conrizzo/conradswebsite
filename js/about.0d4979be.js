To publish modifications to the website, one can run the command \"npm run deploy\". This will first build the vue.js application by running \"npm run build\", and then put the production build of the website into the 'dist' folder. A copy of the index.html file that is built in the 'dist' folder is created and renamed to 404.html. This is a workaround that allows router-linking in vue.js to work correctly for all routes. Without this workaround, direct URL links such as https://conradswebsite.com/projects/cowculator would not work and instead show a 404 error on GitHub Pages. However, by creating a copy of index.html and renaming it to 404.html whenever the site is updated, all addresses now work properly by falling back to the index.html page. This solution may not be ideal, but it is necessary when using gh-pages.
